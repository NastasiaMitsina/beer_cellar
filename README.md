##### In order to create this application I used React because it provides amazing developer tools.
Using components is wonderful. It allows to start with small things, which are used to build bigger things. Each component has its own logic and controls its own rendering. React is also known for Virtual DOM, which help to update only those data whach has changed.

The application meeets the following requirements:
*	A list of kegs
*	Detail view of a beer keg
*	Possibility to add new kegs
*	Sorting in list view (name, abv and IBU)
*	Searching kegs in list view (name, abv and IBU).
*	Used remote API to fill in details.

### To run this app on your local machine  clone this repository and enter the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
